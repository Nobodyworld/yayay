    total_points = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    tier = models.CharField(max_length=20, default='Unranked')

    def update_tier(self):
        """Update the persona's tier based on points and interaction metrics."""
        if self.total_points > 3000:
            self.tier = 'Gold'
        elif self.total_points > 2000:
            self.tier = 'Silver'
        elif self.total_points > 1000:
            self.tier = 'Bronze'
        self.save()

    def calculate_total_points(self):
        """Calculates total points from all interactions and achievements."""
        interaction_points = self.persona.interactions.aggregate(total=Sum('points'))['total'] or 0
        achievement_points = self.persona.achievements.aggregate(total=Sum('points'))['total'] or 0
        self.total_points = interaction_points + achievement_points
