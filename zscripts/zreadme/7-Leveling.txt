     - **Model:** `Skill`
     - **Key Features:**
       - Fields: `name`, `description`, and association with an `Attribute`.
       - Unique identifier for each skill.

2. **Skill Level Tracking:**
   - **Model:** `SkillLevel`
   - **Key Features:**
     - Foreign key relationships to `Persona` and `Skill`.
     - Fields: `experience_points` and `level`.
     - Methods to add experience points and update skill levels.

3. **Attribute Level Aggregation:**
   - **Model:** `AttributeLevel`
   - **Key Features:**
     - Foreign key relationships to `Persona` and `Attribute`.
     - Field: `total_points`.
     - Methods to update total points based on related skill experience.

4. **Service Layers:**
   - **Service:** `LevelingService`
   - **Key Features:**
     - Methods to update skill scores and attribute levels.
     - Transaction management to ensure consistency.

5. **Signal Handlers:**
   - **Signals:** Defined in `signals.py`
   - **Key Features:**
     - Post-save signals to handle updates on `SkillLevel` changes.
     - Ensures real-time updates to attribute levels based on skill interactions.

6. **Admin Interface:**
   - **Models Registered:** `Attribute`, `Skill`, `AttributeLevel`, `SkillLevel`
   - **Key Features:**
     - Admin configurations for list display, filters, and search fields.

7. **API Endpoints:**
   - **ViewSets:** `AttributeViewSet`, `SkillViewSet`, `SkillLevelViewSet`, `AttributeLevelViewSet`
   - **Key Features:**
     - CRUD operations for managing attributes and skills.
     - Permissions for authenticated or read-only access.

8. **Testing:**
   - **Tests:** Defined in `tests.py`
   - **Key Features:**
     - Factories for creating test data.
     - Test cases for skill experience addition, attribute level updates, and service layer functionalities.

**Enhanced Features:**

- **Experience Points Calculation:**
  - Automatic calculation and distribution of experience points based on predefined criteria and user interactions.
  
- **Level-Up Notifications:**
  - Inform users when their personas level up in a skill or attribute.

- **Detailed Logging:**
  - Comprehensive logging of all experience point transactions and level changes for auditing and debugging purposes.

**Technical Considerations:**

- **Model Relationships:**
  - Utilize Djangoâ€™s ORM to define and enforce relationships between personas, skills, and attributes.

- **Transactional Integrity:**
  - Ensure all updates to experience points and levels are atomic to maintain data consistency.

- **Extensibility:**
  - Design models and services to be easily extensible for adding new attributes or skills without disrupting existing functionalities.
