### Project Overview

This project is designed to organize and dynamically manage elements of personal and collective identity, motivation, and capabilities. The core attributes—will, meaning, knowledge, and wisdom—are fundamental and change based on user interactions within the system. Users can create personas, set goals, manage possessions, solve problems, and create artifacts. The system aggregates these elements to form a comprehensive overview of individual and collective contributions.

### Conceptual Framework

#### Fundamental Elements

1. **Will**: The fundamental drive and motivation.
2. **Meaning**: The purpose derived from will.
3. **Knowledge**: The information and understanding obtained from meaning.
4. **Wisdom**: The integration and deeper insight of will, meaning, and knowledge.

#### Hierarchical Structure

##### User/Collectives
- **User**: The private version of a person encompassing all personal elements. This information is visible only to the user, who can choose what to display publicly.
- **Collectives**: Aggregated collections of users' contributions and shared elements.

##### Collective Individual
- **Collective Individual**: A public version of a person derived from the aggregation of their public personas and contributions.

### Example Use Case

A user creates a "Mom" persona with goals, possessions, problems, etc. She sets a goal to teach her kids about all the states in the US. As she completes her goal, solves problems, and creates artifacts, her "Mom" persona's will, meaning, knowledge, and wisdom increase. Knowledge and understanding are paired, so as knowledge increases, understanding and associated skills also increase.

### Default Landings and User Experience

To improve user experience:
1. **Home Page**: Provide a dashboard with an overview of key metrics and recent activities.
2. **Loading Indicators**: Implement a friendly loading screen that disappears once the content is fully loaded.
3. **User Guidance**: Add tooltips and contextual help to guide users through their tasks and goals.
4. **Clear Navigation**: Ensure the navbar and side menus are intuitive and provide quick access to all major sections.
